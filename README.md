- 👋 Hi, I’m @saravalentinal
- 👀 I’m interested in coding in the middle of a forest, maybe a mountain, perhaps a river.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a full stack web developer, also I'm studying german and pretty much anything I care about.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something that starts from the heart and aims to help perceive the world in a much more sensible way.
- 📫 How to reach me (pictures of your pets are very welcome): ds/ Sara Valentina#6751 mail/ latynsara41@gmail.com
